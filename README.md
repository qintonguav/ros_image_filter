# ros_image_filter

Merge two image. The output image is twice size of the original images.

i.e. we have two images, we combine the two images directly, the right half is one image, the left size is another image.

In addition, in this code, we do translation from ROS::msg to OPENCV::mat, also OPENCV::mat to ROS::msg.
